# THE IRON VANGUARD
*A mercenary hero company forged in war and hardened by profit.*

---

## Overview
The **Iron Vanguard** is a private paramilitary “hero agency” known for:
- Military precision  
- Strict discipline  
- Advanced exosuits  
- High collateral damage  
- And a PR machine that sanitizes everything they do  

To the public, they are **polished heroes**—  
corporate-sponsored, militarized protectors of the peace.

To those who’ve seen them up close, they are:
- A mercenary army wearing hero licenses  
- A for-profit security force  
- A powder keg waiting to be lit  

They fight villains, yes.  
But only if the contract is good.

# Philosophy & Code
Internally, the Vanguard lives by:

> **“Strength, Order, Victory.”**

Their public motto is gentler:

> **“We protect because we can.”**

But their real priorities are:
1. **Profit**  
2. **Reputation**  
3. **Tactical advantage**  
4. **The mission**  
5. **Civilians (optional and situational)**

They claim to be heroes.  
They operate like soldiers.  
They think like business executives.

# Structure

The Iron Vanguard is built like a privatized military company:

### 1. Command  
Corporate executives and decorated veterans who oversee assets, missions, and finances.

### 2. Captains  
Elite exosuit pilots who lead field teams.  
Each Captain is a minor celebrity.

### 3. Vanguards  
Standard armored operatives—trained, shard-enhanced soldiers with top-tier gear.

### 4. Recruits  
Fresh trainees hoping to earn their suit and license.

### 5. Support Corps  
Engineers, medics, technicians, PR staff, drone operators, and analysts.

The Iron Vanguard operates out of a fortified megastructure known as **The Bastion**, half base and half branding headquarters.

# Relationships

## With the Nightwatch
Official stance: **“Unlicensed vigilantes endanger the public.”**  
Unofficial stance: **“They interfere with contracts.”**

Lanternjack distrusts them deeply.  
Some Nightwatch members have fought them.

## With the Undertow
Occasional enemies, occasional business partners.  
The Vanguard will fight the Undertow—  
**if paid to.**

## With the Public
Loved, marketed, mythologized.

Their PR budget is larger than the police department’s annual funding.

---

# Themes
The Iron Vanguard represents:
- Militarized heroism  
- Corporate power  
- Ruthless order  
- The price of safety  
- The conflict between public image and private brutality  

They are heroes in the same way a hammer is a solution:
**effective, blunt, and unconcerned with nuance.**

---

# Summary
The Iron Vanguard is a shining steel wall between the city and chaos—  
but a wall that charges for access.

Their soldiers are proud, their leaders ambitious, and their tech unmatched.

Are they heroes?  
Are they mercenaries?  
Or are they the early stages of a corporate army the world isn’t ready for?

The answer changes depending on who signs their checks.
