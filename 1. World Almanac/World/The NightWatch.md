# THE NIGHTWATCH
*A loose alliance of vigilantes who gather only when the city needs them most.*

---

## Overview
The **Nightwatch** is not a formal team.  
It has no headquarters, no permanent membership, and no official hierarchy.

Most of the time, its members operate alone—  
shadowy vigilantes, masked weirdos, street-level detectives, rogue mages, runaway mutants, disgraced heroes, tech-freaks, and those who walk between worlds.

But when danger grows too large, too strange, or too catastrophic for any one of them to face alone…

A single signal spreads across the underbelly of the city:

> **“Nightwatch. Convene.”**

No one knows how the signal is sent.  
Every vigilante simply *knows*.

---

# Philosophy & Code

The Nightwatch has only one commandment:

> **“Protect the city when no one else can.”**

They distrust:
- Police  
- Corporate heroes  
- Government agents  
- Anyone with a PR department  

But for each other, they have a different kind of trust:
- Hard-won  
- Fragile  
- Unspoken  
- Real  

They operate in the grey, doing what licensed heroes can’t—or won’t.

# The Lantern

## The Guiding Hand of the Watch
The **Lantern** is not a leader or commander.  
It is a *role*, a responsibility shouldered by whoever calls the Watch together during a crisis.

When someone recognizes a threat that demands unity, they become:
- The caller  
- The mediator  
- The mission’s steady hand  

The Lantern’s duties:
1. **Make the Call** — send the signal that convenes the Watch.  
2. **Set Boundaries** — outline the mission and prevent turf wars.  
3. **Keep Peace** — stop vigilantes from fighting each other.  
4. **Disband the Watch** — dissolve the group when the job is done.

The Lantern’s word is not law—  
but it is respected.

Some dread becoming the Lantern.  
Some avoid it entirely.  
Some carry the burden with quiet dignity.

The Undertow has identified the Lantern as the *keystone* of the Watch.  
If they can prevent the Lantern from rising, the Watch falls apart.

# Structure

Though chaotic, the Nightwatch naturally falls into four layers:

### 1. Solos  
Independent vigilantes who usually work alone.  
They may only join the Watch a few times a year.

### 2. Duos & Micro-Cells  
Pairs or trios who operate together more frequently.

### 3. The Circle  
Veteran vigilantes who attend most convenings.  
Not official leaders—just the most experienced.

### 4. The Lantern  
Whichever member called the Watch for the current crisis.

# Anecdote: The Night the Watch Saved SparkSprout

Smoke filled Pier 12 as a terrified teenager struggled to breathe, electricity tearing from his arms. Corporate agents raised their rifles to sedate him.

A single piece of chalk rolled into view.

Lanternjack stepped from the smoke:

> **“Stand down. He’s with the Watch.”**

Shadewalker disabled both agents in silence.  
Wirerat’s drones stabilized the air around the boy.

SparkSprout cried out:

> “I-I didn’t mean to— I can’t— I’m sorry—”

Lanternjack knelt:

> **“You’re scared. That’s fine.”**  
> **“You’re dangerous. Also fine.”**  
> **“You don’t face this alone.”**

Shadewalker whispered:

> **“We’ve all had a first night like this.”**

And so the newest member of the Nightwatch was born.

# Summary
The Nightwatch is a fragile alliance held together by necessity and mutual respect.  
They are not heroes in the traditional sense—  
but when the Lantern shines, they gather.  
When the Lantern dims, they part ways.

Together, they are the city’s last hope when the shadows grow teeth.
