## Overview
The **Undertow** is a powerful smuggling syndicate operating in the drowned corners of the city’s docks, warehouses, canals, and forgotten coastal districts. While most members are ordinary humans driven by desperation or opportunity, their leader — **Marrowdeep** — is anything but human anymore.

The Undertow survives through:
- Human grit  
- Cold efficiency  
- Smuggling expertise  
- And the looming presence of an eldritch titan wearing a human face

Their whispered motto:

> **“The tide pulls all things under.”**

# Leadership

## MARROWDEEP — Titan in Human Form
*“The sea remembers what the land tries to forget.”*

Born as **Ellis Crane**, a dockside nobody, he should have drowned long ago. Instead, something ancient answered him, reshaping him into a vessel of the deep. He still wears a human form, but traces of the abyss leak through:  
- Eyes too black  
- Breath like tidewater  
- A second heartbeat like a wave under stone  
- Shadows that move as if underwater

He does not seek conquest.  
He seeks inevitability — a slow drowning of the city over years.

# The Inner Circle

## THE DROWNED
*“Three breaths held. Three souls given. Three captains reborn.”*

The Drowned are **Marrowdeep’s three chosen captains**, drowned by his own hand and remade by the One Beneath the Waves. He took them each out to sea in a silent rowboat and held them under until their lungs filled. Hours later, he returned alone, towing their bodies behind him. By dawn, they rose again, breathing water and standing reborn.

They are not mutants.  
Not gods.  
Not men.  
Something between.

He does not conquer.  
He collects.

The Undertow aims for the slow drowning of the city — one life, one secret, one deal at a time.

# Summary
The Undertow is a blend of:
- Crime noir  
- Cosmic horror  
- Organized smuggling  
- Mutant transformations  
- Slow inevitability  

Their leader is a **human-turned-titan**, their elite are **drowned captains reborn**, and their ranks are filled with **desperate humans** pulled into the tide.

The city will not fall to them at once.  
It will **sink slowly**, piece by piece, until it belongs to the deep.
