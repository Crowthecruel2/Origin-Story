# THE CHILDREN OF CHANGE
*A cult of mutation, revelation, and forced evolution.*

---

## Overview
The **Children of Change** believe one thing with absolute certainty:

> **“Humanity is incomplete. We are the larval stage.”**

To them, mutation is not a curse—  
it is **a sacrament**.

The Children worship **Change** itself as a cosmic force that selects the worthy, reshapes the faithful, and consumes the stagnant. They operate underground labs, hidden sanctuaries, and slumside “clinics” where desperate people pay to be “reborn.”

Their followers vary wildly:
- Mutants seeking empowerment  
- Runaways hoping for acceptance  
- Scientists obsessed with bio-evolution  
- Zealots yearning for transcendence  
- Monsters who were once human  

The Children do not fear mutation.  
They **offer it.**

---

# Philosophy & Doctrine

Their central doctrine is carved into bone in every sanctuary:

> **“The flesh is a chrysalis. Break it.”**

The Children teach that:
- Mutation is destiny  
- Pain is transformation  
- The human form is a cage  
- The world belongs to the adaptable  
- Perfection lies at the end of metamorphosis  

They reject societal norms and view “normal humans” as dangerously fragile, trapped in static bodies while the world evolves around them.

They believe they are forging the **next species**.

# Structure

Unlike the hierarchical Iron Vanguard or the chaotic Nightwatch, the Children of Change operate as a **living organism**, divided into roles reflecting the stages of metamorphosis:

### 1. The Gene-Lit (Leadership)
The oldest and most profoundly mutated members.  
They no longer resemble humans.  
They speak with psychic resonance woven from dozens of altered nervous systems.

### 2. Fleshcallers (Scientists & Priests)
Bioengineers, cult prophets, and surgeons.  
They perform the “Rites of Change” and oversee metamorphosis chambers.

### 3. Metamorphs (Ascended Mutants)
Those who survived their transformation.  
Physical forms vary: claws, gills, wings, bone plating, sensory mutations, etc.

### 4. Supplicants (Initiates)
New recruits awaiting transformation.  
Often desperate, poor, or abandoned by society.

### 5. Swarmkin (Mass Mutants)
A collective of failed transformations and aggressive proto-mutants used as expendable shock troops.

The Children call failed metamorphosis **“a necessary shedding.”**

---

# Practices & Rituals

### **Rite of Unmaking**
Strips away the subject's “stagnant traits” through bio-alchemical agents and psychic imprinting.

### **Rite of Becoming**
Exposes the body to catalysts—mutagenic serums, shard-energy fields, or biological reactors.

### **Rite of Emergence**
Survivors awaken with new forms.

Those who die are considered “blessed, but unready,” and their bodies are recycled into cult biotech.

# Relationships

## With the Iron Vanguard
Enemies.  
The Vanguard sees them as bio-terrorists; the Children see the Vanguard as stagnant metal idols clinging to obsolete humanity.

## With the Nightwatch
Complicated.  
Some Watch vigilantes try to rescue initiates.  
Others see the Children as a corruption that must be destroyed.  
Lanternjack calls them “the hardest problem no one wants to solve.”

## With the Undertow
Occasional trade partners for rare biological or mutagenic materials.  
Philosophically opposed:  
The Children worship transformation.  
The Undertow worship inevitability.

---

# Themes
The Children of Change represent:
- Body horror  
- Evolution as religion  
- Desperation turned into devotion  
- Cult indoctrination  
- The quest for transcendence  
- The cost of becoming more than human  

They are not simply villains.  
They are a mirror held up to humanity—  
showing what people become when hope mutates into obsession.

---

# Summary
The Children of Change are a living cult of transformation, guided by the Gene Lord and united by the belief that the human body is merely the first draft of a better species.

Some become monsters.  
Some become miracles.  
All become *changed*.

To the public, they are a threat.  
To their followers, they are salvation.  
To themselves, they are the future.
