Powers are conceptual in nature. They have more power over the world than first seems logical and the longer they are manifested the more obvious this becomes. 

They can be devided into some common categories
- [[Brick]]: Powers that allow for supernatural strength or durability. They are built like brick houses, strong and tough.

- [[Effector]]: Powers that allow the user to effect the enviroment around them to a greater degree.

- [[Genius]]: Powers that effect the inteligence or senses of the user to some degree. Allowing for displays of supernatural skill.

- [[Manipulator]]: Powers that manipulate the minds or actions of creatures near them. This could be people, animals or some constructs

- [[Mutant]]: Powers that visibly change the users anatomy to some degree. 

- [[Ranger]]: A class of powers that gives the user an new set of skills. Some of which may be completely impossible.

- [[Techie]]: Powers that allow the user to create different forms of super tech.

## The Shattered Power

You drift through the endless void. An unending sea of nothingness stretches on in every direction. You drift for what feels like eons—or seconds. You can't tell with the endless nothingness around you. As your mind loops again to sustain against the unyielding blank space around you, you feel it: just on the edge of your awareness something grinds against your being. Power. An all-consuming power. So powerful it hurts to contemplate. In self-defense you lash out and shatter it into shards. They drift with you. Five come within reach, but each is vast enough you can only grasp one. Each shard feels different:

- **Shard of Strength** — Feels of strength of self and other. An unstoppable force into an immovable object. Flesh shifting and knitting into any form; the roar of indestructible animals of war. (Brick)
- **Shard of Control** — Feels of lies and command. An invisible hand on soft grey matter; shadows dancing to the screams of lesser beings; puppets screaming at demons and demons screaming back. (Manipulator)
- **Shard of Force** — Feels of directed and undirected power. Pulses, waves, lasers, beams; shifting elements and shifting territory; drums of war on a brass chariot. (Effector)
- **Shard of Cunning** — Feels of planning and cleverness. A clockwork brain ticking down; unfiltered truth bathed in noxious goo; abstract ideas guarded by looming walls and turrets. (Techie / Genius)
- **Shard of Speed** — Feels of speed and aggression. Wind past a blurring dagger; atoms split and reassembled at breakneck speeds; soothing hands brushing a speeding demon. (Movement / Ranger)

Choosing a shard sets the path of your power. Once chosen, you can still learn from the others—but your core will always echo the first shard you claimed.
