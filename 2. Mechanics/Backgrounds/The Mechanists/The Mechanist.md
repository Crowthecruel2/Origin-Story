Lore: A grumpy old man that's been doing this shit for way too long. Back in the day he use to fight Kaiju's for the government. Now he beats up muggers to keep Brighton safe. His personal mech Firecracker isn't the same machine that use to beat up city destroying monsters like [[G'th'lark the Destroyer]] but she gets the job done. Even outside of the suit the old man still packs a punch with his personal hand cannon old betsy. A mean looking son of a bitch of a revolver.
