Lore: Traumatized Weaponized Orphans found and raised to become the warriors of [[Racoon Man]]'s Justice. They seem to die a lot. Not that this has stopped any of the others from taking their place. They use a diluted version of [[Racoon Man]]'s steroids to level the field between them and grown adults.
