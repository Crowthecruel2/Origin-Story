Lore: While [[Racoon Man]] was training to wield his fist like sledgehammers and cave in the heads of the mentally disabled. His head Butler Butler Man trained the rest of the staff to be as competent as he himself is. Now that the Original Butler Man is retired the rest must take up his mantle while the Racoon is indisposed. Armed with heavy ordinance and dry wit they must lead the birds in his place to secure justice
