# City Factions

## Children of Change
A zealous mutant cult that worships transformation as divine truth. Their bodies shift, warp, and evolve through painful rituals and unstable genetic rites. From ragged Rejects to towering Gene Lords, every abomination is shaped by the cult's belief that flesh must be broken to be perfected. To the Children, mutation is salvation — and the city is fertile ground for rebirth.

## Iron Vanguard
A private military force armed with bleeding-edge exosuits, battlefield uplinks, and orbital weaponry. The Vanguards see every conflict as a contract, every rescue as billable, and every life as an operational variable. Hardened by years of urban warfare, they fight with brutal precision, whether protecting civilians or enforcing a corporation’s interests.

## The Undertow
A sprawling smuggling syndicate rooted in the city’s docks, abandoned storm canals, and tide-worn tunnels. Its enigmatic leader appears human, but those closest swear they’ve seen its eyes change with the moon, or its shadow stretch and ripple like something submerged. Ancient, patient, and terrifyingly intelligent, this creature hides behind a flawless human guise while guiding the Undertow’s operations.

## The Aegis Initiative
A sleek corporate superhero program that markets justice as a premium service. Aegis operatives shine in PR campaigns and televised rescues, yet whispers of hidden labs and buried scandals follow them everywhere.

## Nightwatch
A network of masked street vigilantes who reject registration and oversight. Many have no powers — just grit, trauma, and the willingness to fight where official heroes will not.

## The Synapse Collective
A clandestine cabal of psychics, technopaths, and data-shapers who trade secrets like currency. They manipulate minds, machines, and markets from hidden server vaults deep beneath the city.

## Gaia’s Embrace
An eco‑radical group empowered by plant‑based mutations or elemental spirits. They claim they are restoring balance, even if that means collapsing skyscrapers or turning industrial blocks into living forests.

## The Veiled Arcanum
An ancient order of spellcasters and occult scholars who maintain the city’s mystical equilibrium. Their secrecy breeds distrust, and their internal disputes often spill into the streets.

## The Chronos Syndicate
A gang of time‑manipulators and displaced future-refugees who alter events to shape a timeline they claim is doomed. They weaponize loops, paradoxes, and impossibly precise heists.
