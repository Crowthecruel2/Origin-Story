# Intro

Hello and welcome to War for Brighton, a tactical skirmish wargame set in the Fictional city of Brighton. Brighton is a crime ridden hellscape that makes fun of cities like Goth Ham for being too safe. Made up of more orphanages and laundromats than actual apartments. Superheroes roam the streets in bands for their own safety and criminal gangs stalk them in broad daylight. Do you have what it takes to win and take back the city. Either for yourself or for the common people.

### [[Doctor Devious Nefarious Evil]]

Lore: The lord of the Sequenced. A order of religious nutjobs that think that the next step for the human race is to incorporate animal DNA into themselves to ascend.

A rat which he augmented with Human DNA and a mutagen of his own creation.
